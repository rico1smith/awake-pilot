# Awake-Pilot Project

Awake-Pilot is a driver-monitoring system that uses facial recognition and embedded AI to detect fatigue and drowsiness in real time. This capstone project is built using a Jetson Nano, infrared + RGB cameras, and vibration/audio alert systems.

## Features
- Real-time facial and eye tracking
- Jetson Nano edge AI processing
- Multimodal fatigue alerts (sound + seat vibration)
- Infrared and RGB camera integration
- Radar-based user motion detection

Developed by a team of senior Electrical and Computer Engineering students at Mississippi State University.
